# insertionSort
sorts an array :)

insertion sort works by:

1. iterating through the array
2. at index 1 (2nd value of array), see if index 1 is larger than index 0 and insert number accordingly
3. at index 2 if index is less than any value of the already sorted part of the list, put it before the value
4. repeat until last index is sorted
5. enjoy your sorted list.
